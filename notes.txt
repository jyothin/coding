# Asymptotic Analysis
## Notation
Big Oh: <= expression iterations
O(f(n)) = { g(n): there exists a c>0 and n_0 such that f(n) <= c*g(n_0)
for all n>n_0}
Big Omega: >= expression iterations
Omega(f(n)) >= { g(n): there exists a c>0 and n_0 such that g(n) <= c*f(n_0)
Big Theta: = expression iterations
Theta(f(n)) = { g(n) if and only if g(n) = O(f(n)) and g(n) = Omega(f(n))
for all n>n_0 }
Little Oh: < expression iterations
Little Omega: > expression iterations
Theta: lie in both Big Oh and Big Omega

## Common Asymptotic Notations
O(1) -> constant
O(logn) -> logarithmic
O(n) -> linear
O(nlogn) -> nlogn
O(n^2) -> quadratic
O(n^3) -> cubic
n^O(1) -> polynomial
2^O(n) -> exponential

# Greedy Algorithms
Travelling Salesman problem
Prim's minimal spanning tree
Kruskal's minimum spanning tree
Dijkstra's minimal spanning tree
Graph - map coloring
Graph - Vertex cover
Knapsack problem
Job scheduling problem

# Divide and Conquer Algorithms
Merge sort
Quick sort
Binary search
Strassen's matrix multiplication
Closest pair

# Dynamic Programming
- The problem should be able to be divided into smaller overlapping
sub-problem
- An optimum solution can be achieved by using an optimum solution of
smaller sub-problem
- Dynamic algorithms use memorization
- Can be done in top-down or bottom-up manner

## Examples
Fibonacci number series
Knapsack problem
Tower of Hanoi
All pair shortest path by Floyd-Warshall
Shortest path by Dijkstra
Project scheduling
