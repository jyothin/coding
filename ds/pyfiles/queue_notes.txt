- Queue is an ordered list of elements of similar data types
- is a FIFO structure
- once a new element is inserted into the queue, all the elements inserted
  before the new element in the queue must be removed, to remove the new
element
- peek() function is used to return the value of the first element without
  dequeuing it
- Can be implemented using an array, stack or linked list

Applications:
- Serving requests on a single shared resource, like a printer, CPU task
  scheduling
- call center phone queuing system
- Handling interrupts in a real-time system

Time complexity:
- Enqueu: O(1)
- Dequeue: O(1)
- Size: O(1)
