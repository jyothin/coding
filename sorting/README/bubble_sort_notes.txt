Time complexity:
n-1 comparisons in the 1st pass
n-2 comparisons in the 2nd pass
n-3 comparisons in the 3rd pass
...
3   comparisons in the n-3 pass
2   comparisons in the n-2 pass
1   comparisons in the n-1 pass

(n-1)+(n-2)+(n-3)+...+3+2+1
= (n-1)*(n-1+1)/2
= (n-1)*n/2
= O(n^2) complexity

Space complexity:
Usage of 1 temp variable hence O(1)
